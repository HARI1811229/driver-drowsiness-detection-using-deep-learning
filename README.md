# Driver Drowsiness Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on detecting driver drowsiness using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of driver images to recognize signs of drowsiness and alert the driver accordingly.

# Features
1)Implements deep learning algorithms for image analysis.

2)Detects facial expressions and eye movements indicative of drowsiness using Haar cascades.

3)Raises alerts or notifications based on the detected drowsiness level.

# Requirements
1)Python 3.x

2)TensorFlow

3)Keras

4)OpenCV
